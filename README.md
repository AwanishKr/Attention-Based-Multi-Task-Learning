# DUAL_DEGREE_PROJECT
This repo is about multi-task learning in deep learning framework. I have done this research on tasks of depth estimation and semantic segmentation on cityscape and nyuv2 datasets.
the model is built upon basic U-Net architecture, and have one encoder and two decoders coupled with attenstion mechanisms.
future reseach involves : 
                         multi-task architecture search
